## This Fork

This repository is a customized version of the original [hevy2garmin](https://github.com/drkostas/hevy2garmin) project by [@drkostas](https://github.com/drkostas). The original Hevy → Garmin synchronization and self-hosting architecture remain the foundation of this project and are unchanged. This fork adds:

- **[Personal Record tracking](#personal-records)** — PRs are the highest actual weight recorded for an exercise; no estimated 1RM or any mathematical formula is used
- **PR history**, stored locally in the existing database (SQLite/Postgres)
- **A dedicated PRs dashboard page** showing current records and their history
- **Historical PR synchronization** — the "Sync PRs" button rebuilds the full PR history from your Hevy workouts
- **PR information in Garmin activity descriptions** — new PRs appear as a `🏆 NEW PRs` block in the synced activity's description

This fork does **not** create native Garmin Connect Personal Records. These PR features are additions of this fork and are not part of the original project. Everything else documented below comes from the original project.

## Why?

Hevy is great for tracking gym workouts but doesn't sync to Garmin. This tool bridges the gap:

- **Maps 433+ Hevy exercises** to Garmin FIT SDK categories so bench press shows as bench press, not "Other"
- **Generates proper FIT files** with exercise structure, sets, reps, weights, and timing
- **Uploads to Garmin Connect** with the correct activity name and a detailed description
- **Estimates calories** using the Keytel formula (weight, age, VO2max, heart rate)
- **Overlays heart rate data** from your Garmin watch onto workout charts with per-exercise segments
- **Tracks personal records** — the highest actual weight you've lifted per exercise, shown on a dashboard page and called out in the Garmin activity description
- **Tracks synced workouts** so nothing gets duplicated

## Requirements

- **[Hevy Pro](https://hevyapp.com) subscription** (required for API access)
- A [Garmin Connect](https://connect.garmin.com) account
- Python 3.10+ (for local install only, not needed for the Vercel deploy)

## Quick Start

Pick the option that fits you best:

### Vercel Deploy (no coding required)

Deploy from your phone or computer in about 5 minutes. No terminal or coding needed.

> **You need [Hevy Pro](https://hevyapp.com) for API access.** Free Hevy accounts cannot use hevy2garmin.

**Step 1: Get your Hevy API key**

Open [hevy.com/settings](https://hevy.com/settings), scroll to **Developer** (Hevy recently renamed this section from **Integrations & API**), click **Generate API Key**, and copy it. If you don't see this section, you need to upgrade to Hevy Pro.

**Step 2: Create a free GitHub account** (skip if you already have one)

Sign up at [github.com](https://github.com/signup). You'll use this to sign into Vercel too.

**Step 3: Create a GitHub access token**

This token lets hevy2garmin set up automatic syncing on your behalf. Open [this link](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo,workflow&description=hevy2garmin) (sign in if prompted):

1. Set **Expiration** to **No expiration** (otherwise auto-sync stops when it expires)
2. Scroll to the bottom, click **Generate token**
3. **Copy the token immediately** (starts with `ghp_`). GitHub only shows it once.

**Step 4: Fork the repo**

[Fork hevy2garmin on GitHub](https://github.com/drkostas/hevy2garmin/fork) -- click the green **Create fork** button. This gives you your own copy that stays linked to the original, so you can pull updates later with one click.

**Step 5: Deploy to Vercel**

1. Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new) and sign in with GitHub
2. Find **hevy2garmin** in your repo list and click **Import**. If your fork isn't listed even though GitHub shows it, click **Adjust GitHub App Permissions** (or **Configure GitHub App**) and grant Vercel access to the repo, then it will appear.
3. **Add a database (required).** If you see an **Integrations** or **Storage** section during import, add **Neon Postgres** (it's free). This is where your sync history lives. If you don't see it during import, that's fine: deploy first, then open your project's **Storage** tab, add **Neon Postgres**, and redeploy. A serverless host has a read-only filesystem, so with no database the app can't save anything and shows an "internal server error".
4. **Environment Variables.** Vercel does not pre-fill these. The form shows an empty field with a placeholder like `EXAMPLE_NAME`. Add each of the four below as its own variable: type the name in **Key**, the value in **Value**, then click **Add More** for the next one.

| Key               | What to paste                |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `HEVY_API_KEY`    | The API key from step 1      |
| `GARMIN_EMAIL`    | Your Garmin Connect email    |
| `GARMIN_PASSWORD` | Your Garmin Connect password |
| `GITHUB_PAT`      | The token from step 3        |

5. Click **Deploy** and wait about a minute for it to build. If the deployed page shows an "internal server error", it almost always means the database step was skipped: add **Neon Postgres** from the **Storage** tab, then redeploy.

**Step 6: Connect Garmin**

Click **Continue to Dashboard**, then **Visit** to open your app. Bookmark this URL -- it's your dashboard.

On the setup page, enter your Garmin email and password and click **Connect**.

- If your Garmin account **does not** have 2FA enabled, you're connected in a second. That's it.
- If your Garmin account **has 2FA enabled**, Garmin emails you a 6-digit code. A code input appears on the page, paste the code, click **Verify**. Done.

Then click **Save & Continue**.

Garmin blocks automated logins from cloud servers (AWS, Azure, Vercel), so hevy2garmin routes the login through a Cloudflare Worker that runs on Cloudflare's edge network. Garmin accepts those IPs, so the whole flow happens in a single click from the dashboard -- no browser tab switching, no URL copying.

> **Fallback for edge cases:** on the rare occasion Garmin doesn't accept the direct login (most often when the account has an unusual security configuration), the setup page automatically reveals the old "Sign into Garmin in a new tab and paste the URL back" flow as a safety net. You don't need to do anything differently -- just follow the instructions the page shows you.

**Step 7: Sync your workouts**

You're on the dashboard. Click **Sync All Workouts** to backfill your history. The app syncs one workout at a time (you can close the page and come back, it picks up where it left off).

> **EU users:** If you see an upload consent error, go to [Garmin Connect Settings](https://connect.garmin.com/modern/settings) > scroll to **Data** > enable **Device Upload**. This is a one-time Garmin GDPR requirement.

To keep future workouts syncing automatically, toggle **Auto-sync** on the dashboard and pick a check interval (as low as 5 minutes on Docker).

> **Sync timing:** hevy2garmin waits `sync.grace_period_minutes` (default 5)
> after a workout ends before syncing it automatically, so your Garmin watch
> activity can land first and it merges into one activity instead of creating a
> duplicate. On Vercel the default cron runs once a day; if your plan allows,
> lower the cron interval (e.g. every few hours) so recently-finished workouts
> sync the same day. Manual "Sync now" always ignores the grace period.

**That's it.** Check [Garmin Connect](https://connect.garmin.com/modern/activities) to see your workouts with proper exercise names, sets, reps, and weights.

### Web Dashboard (local install)

```bash
pip install hevy2garmin
hevy2garmin serve
```

> Not on PyPI yet? Install from source: `git clone https://github.com/drkostas/hevy2garmin.git && cd hevy2garmin && pip install .`

Open [localhost:8123](http://localhost:8123). The setup wizard walks you through connecting Hevy and Garmin.

Once you click **Sync Now**, your workouts appear in [Garmin Connect](https://connect.garmin.com/modern/activities) within a few seconds. Enable **auto-sync** on the dashboard to keep things synced on a schedule (30 min to 24 hours).

To keep the server running in the background:

```bash
nohup hevy2garmin serve > /dev/null 2>&1 &
```

<details>
<summary>systemd service file (Linux)</summary>

Save as `/etc/systemd/system/hevy2garmin.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=hevy2garmin dashboard
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=hevy2garmin serve
Restart=always
User=your-username
Environment=HEVY_API_KEY=your-key
Environment=GARMIN_EMAIL=your-email

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Then `sudo systemctl enable --now hevy2garmin`.

</details>

### CLI

```bash
pip install hevy2garmin

# Interactive setup (Hevy API key + Garmin credentials)
hevy2garmin init

# Sync your 10 most recent workouts
hevy2garmin sync

# List recent workouts (checkmark = already synced)
hevy2garmin list

# Check sync status
hevy2garmin status

# Dry run (generate FIT files without uploading)
hevy2garmin sync --dry-run

# Sync last 5 workouts only
hevy2garmin sync -n 5
```

After syncing, check [Garmin Connect](https://connect.garmin.com/modern/activities) to see your workouts.

**Recurring sync without the dashboard:** set up a crontab after running `hevy2garmin init`:

```bash
# Sync every 2 hours (uses credentials saved by hevy2garmin init)
0 */2 * * * hevy2garmin sync
```

### Docker

```bash
git clone https://github.com/drkostas/hevy2garmin.git
cd hevy2garmin
docker build -t hevy2garmin .
```

Before running in Docker, you need Garmin auth tokens. Either:

- Run `pip install hevy2garmin && hevy2garmin init` locally (if you have Python), or
- Run `docker run -it -v ~/.garminconnect:/root/.garminconnect hevy2garmin init` to set up inside Docker interactively

**Web dashboard with auto-sync:**

```bash
docker run -d -p 8123:8123 --restart unless-stopped \
  -v ~/.hevy2garmin:/root/.hevy2garmin \
  -v ~/.garminconnect:/root/.garminconnect \
  -e HEVY_API_KEY=... \
  -e GARMIN_EMAIL=... \
  hevy2garmin serve
```

Open [localhost:8123](http://localhost:8123) and enable auto-sync on the dashboard.

**One-off sync:**

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v ~/.hevy2garmin:/root/.hevy2garmin \
  -v ~/.garminconnect:/root/.garminconnect \
  -e HEVY_API_KEY=... \
  -e GARMIN_EMAIL=... \
  hevy2garmin sync
```

### Python API

```bash
pip install hevy2garmin
```

Before using the API, make sure credentials are available via `~/.hevy2garmin/config.json` (run `hevy2garmin init`), environment variables, or pass them directly.

```python
from hevy2garmin.sync import sync

# Uses config from ~/.hevy2garmin/config.json (or env vars)
result = sync()
print(f"Synced: {result['synced']}, Skipped: {result['skipped']}")

# Or pass credentials directly (no config file needed)
result = sync(hevy_api_key="...", garmin_email="...", garmin_password="...")
```

```python
# Just the exercise mapper
from hevy2garmin.mapper import lookup_exercise

cat, subcat, name = lookup_exercise("Bench Press (Barbell)")
# (0, 1, "Bench Press (Barbell)")

# Just FIT generation (see Hevy API docs for workout dict format:
# https://docs.hevy.com/#tag/workout/operation/workout)
from hevy2garmin.fit import generate_fit

result = generate_fit(hevy_workout_dict, hr_samples=None, output_path="workout.fit")
```

For cloud deployments (Vercel, CI/CD), install with Postgres support:

```bash
pip install hevy2garmin[cloud]
```

This adds `psycopg2-binary` and enables automatic Postgres backend detection via `DATABASE_URL`.

### TypeScript / npm

The same logic is available as a TypeScript package for Node, serverless functions, and Vercel crons, so you can run the sync without a Python runtime.

```bash
npm install hevy2garmin
```

```ts
import { generateFit, HevyClient } from 'hevy2garmin';
```

It lives alongside the Python package in the [`typescript/`](typescript) folder of this repo and is published to npm under the same name. Setup, the full API, and examples are in the [TypeScript README](typescript/README.md). The Python package on PyPI stays fully supported.

## Getting Your Hevy API Key

> **Hevy Pro is required.** API access is not available on the free plan.

1. Go to [Hevy Settings](https://hevyapp.com/settings) > Developer (formerly Integrations & API)
2. Click **Generate API Key** and copy it
3. Paste it into `hevy2garmin init`, the web dashboard setup, or set as `HEVY_API_KEY` env var

If you don't see the Developer section, you need to upgrade to [Hevy Pro](https://hevyapp.com).

## Credentials

**Three ways to provide credentials** (in order of precedence):

1. CLI flags: `--hevy-api-key`, `--garmin-email`, `--garmin-password`
2. Environment variables: `HEVY_API_KEY`, `GARMIN_EMAIL`, `GARMIN_PASSWORD`
3. Config file: `~/.hevy2garmin/config.json` (created by `hevy2garmin init` or the web dashboard)

See [`.env.example`](.env.example) for all available env vars.

**Garmin authentication:** Only needs the password for initial login. After that, tokens are cached (in `~/.garminconnect` locally or in Postgres for cloud deploys) and refresh automatically.

> **Cloud deploys (Vercel):** Garmin blocks automated logins from cloud servers, so hevy2garmin routes the login through a Cloudflare Worker (`hevy2garmin-exchange-di.gkos.workers.dev`) that runs on Cloudflare's edge network. The Worker accepts your email + password from the setup page, completes the login (including 2FA if enabled), and returns a DI OAuth token that hevy2garmin stores in your Postgres database. This happens in a single click from the setup wizard. On the rare occasion Garmin rejects the direct login, the setup page automatically falls back to a "sign in via browser, paste the URL back" flow.

## Securing the dashboard

The dashboard has no login by default (fine for a private local install). **If you deploy it to a public URL, protect it** — otherwise anyone who finds the URL can see your data.

- **Set a password.** Set `H2G_PASSWORD` to require login on every page and API route. Without it the dashboard is open, so **always set a password before putting it on a public URL**.
- **Avoid plaintext (optional).** Run `hevy2garmin hash-password` to generate an argon2 hash and set it as `H2G_PASSWORD_HASH` instead of `H2G_PASSWORD`, so the plaintext password never lives in your environment.
- **Brute-force protection.** Failed logins are rate-limited per IP with exponential backoff and a global cap; repeated attempts get HTTP 429 with a cooldown.
- **Sessions.** Login sets a signed, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict` cookie (7-day TTL by default, configurable via `H2G_SESSION_TTL_DAYS`), marked `Secure` over HTTPS. Setting `H2G_SECRET` (recommended, especially with `H2G_PASSWORD_HASH`) signs sessions with a dedicated key, so rotating the password doesn't sign everyone out. **Sign out all devices** (Settings → Sessions &amp; Security) invalidates every active session at once.

See [`.env.example`](.env.example) for all the related variables.

## Self-hosting

The Vercel deploy is the quickest way to run hevy2garmin, but it is not the only one. Running it on your own machine — a spare box, a NAS, a Raspberry Pi — keeps your Hevy and Garmin data on hardware you control, and removes the once-a-day cron ceiling that serverless imposes.

### Docker Compose (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/drkostas/hevy2garmin.git
cd hevy2garmin
cp .env.example .env      # set HEVY_API_KEY and H2G_PASSWORD
docker compose up -d --build
```

Open [localhost:8123](http://localhost:8123) and connect Garmin from the setup page.

The compose file uses named volumes for the sync database and the Garmin token store. Keep them: the token store is what saves you re-authenticating with Garmin (tokens last roughly a year), and the database is what stops already-synced workouts uploading twice.

It also binds the port to `127.0.0.1` rather than all interfaces, drops all capabilities, and sets `no-new-privileges`. The image runs as an unprivileged user (uid 999).

### Keeping credentials on your own machine

Two settings matter if the point of self-hosting is that nothing leaves your network:

- **`H2G_DIRECT_GARMIN_LOGIN=true`** — collect your Garmin password and MFA code on your own instance and run the login there, instead of posting them to the hosted exchange worker the Vercel deploy uses. Off by default; the worker path is unchanged unless you set this. Requires a writable home directory, so it is for self-hosted installs only, not serverless.
  The resulting token store lives in `~/.garminconnect` by default (`garmin_token_dir` in `~/.hevy2garmin/config.json`). Back that directory up and you will not have to log in again after a rebuild — which is what the `garmin_auth` volume in the compose file is for.

Your Hevy API key stays local either way.

### Behind a reverse proxy

Put the dashboard behind nginx, Caddy or Traefik on a subdomain, terminate TLS there, and keep the container bound to `127.0.0.1`. **Set `H2G_PASSWORD` before exposing it** — see [Securing the dashboard](#securing-the-dashboard).

Serving it at the **root of a subdomain** (`https://hevy.example.com/`) works with no extra configuration.

Serving it under a **sub-path** (`https://example.com/hevy2garmin/`) works too. It needs two things: the proxy tells the app which sub-path it is mounted at, and you set `H2G_TRUST_FORWARDED_PREFIX=true` so the app believes it.

```nginx
location /hevy2garmin/ {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8123/;
    proxy_set_header Host              $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Prefix /hevy2garmin;
}
```

**The opt-in is not busywork.** Any client can send `X-Forwarded-Prefix`, and every URL on the page is built from it — the login form's `action`, the Garmin token POST, redirect targets. On an instance that is _not_ behind a prefix-setting proxy, believing the header would let a caller re-point those at their own host. So the header is ignored unless you turn this on, and even then only a plain absolute path is accepted (no `//host`, no scheme, no quotes or angle brackets); anything else is treated as no prefix and the app serves from the root. **Your proxy must set the header itself rather than passing a client-supplied one through.**

Caddy equivalent (`header_up` replaces any incoming value, which is what you want):

```caddyfile
handle_path /hevy2garmin/* {
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8123 {
        header_up X-Forwarded-Prefix /hevy2garmin
    }
}
```

The app then emits every link, asset, form action, htmx call, redirect and JavaScript-built API URL under that prefix. The proxy does **not** need to rewrite response bodies. Without the header nothing changes, so a root install and the Vercel deploy are unaffected.

### Keeping it in sync

Auto-sync runs on a timer inside the process, so a self-hosted instance can poll as often as you like — enable it and set the interval on the dashboard. This is the main practical difference from the Vercel deploy, where scheduling comes from a platform cron that is limited to once per day on Vercel's Hobby plan.

### Syncing on a Hevy webhook instead of polling

Polling means a finished workout waits up to a full interval. Hevy can push instead: point a Hevy webhook subscription at `POST /api/cron/webhook`, authenticated with the same `CRON_SECRET` bearer token as the cron endpoint.

A webhook that synced immediately would be _worse_ than polling for watch users, though: the paired Garmin activity has not arrived yet, the merge finds nothing, and the workout uploads as a plain FIT — leaving exactly the duplicate the merge exists to avoid. So the endpoint answers 200 straight away (Hevy times out in seconds) and stages the sync:

| Variable                         | Default | Meaning                                 |
| -------------------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `WEBHOOK_DELAY_SECONDS`          | `300`   | Wait this long before the first attempt |
| `WEBHOOK_RETRY_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | `600`   | Gap between attempts                    |
| `WEBHOOK_MAX_ATTEMPTS`           | `3`     | Attempts before giving up               |

Every attempt but the last is merge-only; only the final one falls back to a plain upload, so nothing is left unsynced. Retry state is in memory, so a restart drops it — auto-sync stays the safety net, and is worth leaving enabled at a long interval.

`CRON_SECRET` must be set for the endpoint to work at all — with no secret configured it answers `503` rather than accepting unauthenticated calls, since it is internet-facing and is deliberately exempt from the dashboard password. At most `WEBHOOK_MAX_INFLIGHT` (4) staged syncs run at once; past that a request is acknowledged but not staged, because the ones already running plus auto-sync cover the work.

**On serverless this staging cannot run**, because the function is frozen as soon as it responds and Python on Vercel has no `waitUntil`. The endpoint detects that and does the only safe thing instead: with the watch merge on it defers to the scheduled cron (and logs that it did); with the watch merge off there is nothing to wait for, so it syncs inline — which on Vercel's Hobby plan replaces a once-a-day cron with a sync per workout.

> One caveat for that last case: an inline sync can take longer than Hevy's few-second timeout, and Hevy then retries. On serverless the retry is a _separate process_, so the in-process sync lock cannot serialize the two, and the same workout could upload twice. It only applies with the watch merge off (not the default) on a serverless host; if that is your setup, prefer leaving the webhook unconfigured and relying on cron.

### Removing duplicates from intervals.icu

The `replace` watch strategy deletes the watch recording from Garmin once the named activity is uploaded, so Garmin ends up with one activity. Garmin deletions do not propagate, though: if you also sync Garmin to [intervals.icu](https://intervals.icu), the copy it already pulled stays there, and every merged workout leaves a duplicate behind.

Set both of these and hevy2garmin deletes it there as well, matched on the Garmin activity id:

```
INTERVALS_API_KEY=
INTERVALS_ATHLETE_ID=
```

Entirely opt-in — with either one missing the step is skipped. It also never fails a sync: intervals.icu being down or slow is logged and ignored, because the Garmin upload has already succeeded by that point.

### Running as a non-root user

The image runs as uid 999. Named volumes (what the compose file uses) are handled automatically. If you use **bind mounts** instead — the `-v ~/.hevy2garmin:/root/.hevy2garmin` form shown in the Docker section — grant that user access once:

```bash
sudo chown -R 999:999 ~/.hevy2garmin ~/.garminconnect
```

The paths inside the container are unchanged, so nothing needs moving.

## Updating

### Vercel (fork-based deploy)

Your Vercel project is linked to your GitHub fork. To get the latest version:

1. Go to your fork on GitHub (e.g. `github.com/your-username/hevy2garmin`)
2. Click **Sync fork** → **Update branch** (this pulls the latest changes from the original repo)
3. Vercel auto-deploys when your fork updates. Wait ~1 minute for the build to finish.
4. Open your dashboard URL and reconnect Garmin if prompted (token format may change between versions)

**If you deployed before April 2026** using the old one-click button, your repo may be a standalone copy instead of a fork ("Sync fork" button won't appear). To migrate:

1. [Fork hevy2garmin](https://github.com/drkostas/hevy2garmin/fork) to your GitHub account
2. In Vercel dashboard → your project → **Settings** → **Git** → disconnect the old repo
3. Connect the new fork → redeploy
4. Your Neon database and env vars stay intact (they're on the Vercel project, not the repo)
5. You can delete the old standalone copy from GitHub to avoid having two "hevy2garmin" repos

### pip

```bash
pip install --upgrade hevy2garmin
```

### Docker

```bash
cd hevy2garmin
git pull origin main
docker build -t hevy2garmin .
```

### Git clone (local)

```bash
cd hevy2garmin
git pull origin main
pip install -e .
```

## Activity Description

When hevy2garmin syncs a workout, it adds a text description to the Garmin activity summarizing your session:

```
🏋️ Push Day
⏱️ 52 min
🔥 387 kcal
❤️ avg 118 bpm

• Bench Press (Barbell): 3 sets · 80.0kg × 8
• Incline Dumbbell Press: 3 sets · 28.0kg × 10
• Cable Fly: 3 sets · 15.0kg × 12

— synced by hevy2garmin
```

This is visible in the activity details on Garmin Connect and any connected apps (Strava, etc.). Cardio exercises show distance and duration instead of weight and reps.

When a workout sets one or more [personal records](#personal-records), a PR block is added between the stats and the exercise list:

```
🏆 NEW PRs
• Bench Press (Barbell): 100 kg
• Incline Dumbbell Press: 34 kg
```

Workouts without a new PR keep exactly the description shown above.

## Personal Records

hevy2garmin tracks a personal record (PR) per exercise: **the highest actual weight you have successfully recorded in Hevy**, using the `weight_kg` value from your sets.

The definition is deliberately simple:

- There is **no estimated 1RM** and no Epley (or any other) formula.
- Reps play no role in the comparison — 100 kg × 1 beats 95 kg × 10.
- There are no volume or rep-based PRs.
- **Warm-up sets never count.** Every other set type (normal, failure, drop set) does.
- Sets without a positive weight — bodyweight exercises, cardio — never create a weight PR. No artificial weights are invented.
- Exercises are identified by Hevy's exercise template id (falling back to the exercise name for custom exercises without one), so "Bench Press (Barbell)" is the same PR chain in every workout.

### During normal sync

PR detection runs automatically as part of the existing Hevy → Garmin sync — it doesn't replace or change how workouts are uploaded or merged. For each synced workout, the highest non-warm-up weight per exercise is compared against your stored PR:

- **Strictly higher** → a new PR is recorded and listed in the Garmin activity description (see [Activity Description](#activity-description)).
- **Equal or lower** → nothing changes.

Re-syncing the same workout never creates duplicate PR entries.

### Garmin Connect and native PRs

The PR feature does **not** create or update Garmin Connect's own Personal Records. Garmin exposes no API for writing them. What you get on the Garmin side is the `🏆 NEW PRs` block in the activity description — the authoritative PR list lives in hevy2garmin, on the dashboard's **PRs** page.

### The PRs page

The dashboard's **PRs** tab lists your current record for every exercise — weight, reps on that set, the date, and the workout it came from. Exercises with more than one recorded PR show an expandable history of previous records:

```
Bench Press (Barbell)    100 kg    2026-08-22    Push Day
  2 previous PRs
    90 kg · 2026-08-08 · Push Day
    80 kg · 2026-08-01 · Push Day
```

### Sync PRs (backfill)

The **Sync PRs** button on the PRs page builds (or rebuilds) your PR history from your full Hevy workout history:

1. Fetches all workouts from the Hevy API (same integration and rate limits as a full workout sync — expect roughly a minute per few hundred workouts).
2. Replays them in chronological order, finding the highest non-warm-up weight per exercise.
3. Records every point where a new highest weight was achieved.
4. Replaces the stored PR history with the result and refreshes the list, with a success or error message.

The rebuild is idempotent — running it twice produces the same records — so it's safe to re-run anytime, e.g. after editing old workouts in Hevy.

PR data is stored in the same database as everything else (SQLite locally, Postgres on cloud deploys). **No extra setup, environment variables, or services are required.**

## Enhance Watch Activities (opt-in)

By default, hevy2garmin creates a new Garmin activity from your Hevy workout using your watch's daily HR monitoring (~2 min sampling). This works without any behavior change. When a matching watch-recorded workout is found and the **Replace** strategy is selected, hevy2garmin instead downloads that activity's high-resolution HR, saves a durable backup, embeds it in the named Hevy FIT, uploads the replacement, and only then deletes the watch copy. If neither the original FIT nor an existing backup is available, replacement stops and preserves the watch activity.

If you start a **Strength Training** activity on your Garmin watch when you hit the gym, you can enable **Enhance Watch Activities** in the config (`"merge_mode": true`). hevy2garmin detects the matching watch activity and combines it with your Hevy data using the configured watch strategy. The in-place strategies keep the original watch activity; Replace creates one named composite activity. Depending on the selected strategy, benefits include:

- **1-second HR sampling** (vs ~2 min in continuous monitoring)
- **Training effect, EPOC, recovery time, and VO2max impact** remain when an in-place strategy keeps the original activity (Garmin does not transfer these to an uploaded replacement)
- **Correct Strava timestamps** (watch-synced activities use the real time, not upload time)
- **Single activity** on Garmin (no duplicate)

If no matching watch activity is found, hevy2garmin falls back to the default flow automatically. Matching requires 70% temporal overlap with a Strength Training activity within 20 minutes of the Hevy workout start time.

### Non-strength watch activities (climbing, etc.)

By default, only watch activities recorded as **Strength Training** are eligible for enhancement. If you record something else on your watch at the same time as your Hevy workout — e.g. a **Climbing** session — it's matched as **Strength Training only**, so it won't be merged and a separate activity is created instead.

To also enhance e.g. climbing sessions, add the Garmin activity type(s) under **Settings → Enhance Watch Activities → Advanced → Additional Watch Activity Types**, using Garmin's internal type names (comma-separated), for example:

```
bouldering, indoor_climbing
```

or set `merge_activity_types` directly in `config.json`:

```json
"merge_activity_types": ["strength_training", "bouldering", "indoor_climbing"]
```

## How It Works

1. Pulls workouts from the Hevy API
2. Maps each exercise to a Garmin FIT SDK category and subcategory (433+ built-in mappings, plus any custom ones you add)
3. Generates a structured FIT file with timing, sets, reps, weights, and calories
4. Optionally fetches HR data from Garmin daily monitoring and overlays it on the workout
5. Detects new [personal records](#personal-records) (highest actual weight per exercise, warm-ups excluded) and includes them in the activity description
6. Authenticates with Garmin via [garmin-auth](https://pypi.org/project/garmin-auth/) (self-healing OAuth)
7. Uploads the FIT file, renames the activity, and sets the description
8. Tracks synced workouts in SQLite (local) or Postgres (cloud) to avoid duplicates

## Exercise Mapping

433+ Hevy exercises are mapped to Garmin FIT SDK categories. If an exercise isn't mapped it falls back to "Unknown" (category 65534). The web dashboard shows unmapped exercises and lets you add custom mappings with a few clicks. You can also add them via CLI:

```bash
hevy2garmin map "My Custom Exercise" --category 28 --subcategory 0
```

## FAQ

**Is the sync one-way?**
Yes — Hevy → Garmin only. Anything you record directly on your watch stays on
Garmin; it does not flow back into Hevy. Keep logging your gym sessions in Hevy
(it's better for that) and this tool makes sure Garmin knows about them.

**Will my gym workouts get duplicated in Health Connect / on my phone (Android)?**
hevy2garmin uploads each Hevy workout to Garmin Connect once, as a single
Strength Training activity (or merges it into a watch-recorded one if you enable
[Enhance Watch Activities](#enhance-watch-activities-opt-in)). It does not write
to Health Connect directly — whatever Garmin Connect chooses to mirror into
Health Connect is Garmin's behavior. If you use Hevy for the gym and Garmin for
running, your runs are untouched; only your Hevy workouts are added.

**Do I need a Hevy Pro subscription?**
Yes. The Hevy API key requires an active Hevy Pro subscription, and the key stops
working once the subscription lapses. See [Getting Your Hevy API Key](#getting-your-hevy-api-key).

**Does it work with non-Garmin watches (Samsung, Amazfit/Zepp, etc.)?**
The tool reads from **Hevy** and writes to **Garmin Connect** — it's not tied to
a specific watch. The destination is always Garmin Connect, so you need a Garmin
account; the watch brand you wear at the gym doesn't matter. It runs in the
browser/cloud, not on the watch.

**My activity shows the wrong time on Strava.**
When Garmin pushes an API-uploaded activity to Strava, Strava sometimes uses the
upload time instead of the workout time. The FIT file and Garmin Connect have the
correct time — this is a Garmin→Strava quirk for non-watch uploads and isn't
something hevy2garmin can control.

**Does 2FA / MFA work on Garmin?**
Native 2FA support is in progress (tracked in
[#29 on garmin-auth](https://github.com/drkostas/garmin-auth/issues/29)). For now,
if your Garmin account has 2FA enabled, temporarily disable it, connect through
hevy2garmin, then re-enable it — the auth tokens persist for months afterward.
